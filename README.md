An app that provides you a navigation system to provide the safest route to get food, reach hospital or navigate to any
location without going through the areas previously affected by disaster.
It will also be able to predict areas around you prone to the disaster.
The application will also have the information of all the disasters that have occurred previously in your area.
Information here is anything- what was the disaster, last occurrence, magnitude of disaster, preventive
measures etc.
A chat support system can also be added to the app for quicker real-time help.
